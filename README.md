# BabaIsYou

This is our attempt at partly recreating [Baba Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/) as part of our [Videogame](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-informatics-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/VJ) course. We included five custom levels and implemented some of the many word mechanics in the game together with the ability to blow up adjacent blocks by pressing Space (limited to one use) which was not in the original game.

This project is built using C++ and OpenGL and many other libraries that are already included in this repo if you build the 32 bit version. All inclusion paths have been configured already for the 32 bit version as well and you should be able to build the project directly with VisualStudio 2019 or newer.
